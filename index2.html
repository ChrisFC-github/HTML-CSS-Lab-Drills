            <h2>The Little Engine That Could</h2>
            <p>A little railroad <span class="specialspan">engine</span> was employed about a station yard for such work
                as it was built for, pulling a few cars on and off the switches. One morning it was waiting for the next
                call when a long train of freight-cars asked a large engine in the roundhouse to take it over the hill.
                "I can't; that is too much a pull for me", said the great engine built for hard work. Then the train
                asked another engine, and another, only to hear excuses and be refused. In desperation, the train asked
                the little switch engine to draw it up the grade and down on the other side. "I think I can", puffed the
                little locomotive, and put itself in front of the great heavy train. As it went on the little engine
                kept bravely puffing faster and faster, "I think I can, I think I can, I think I can."</p>

                Say! What a lot of fish there are.
                Yes. Some are red, and some are blue.
                Some are old and some are new.
                Some are sad, and some are glad,
                And some are very, very bad.
                Why are they sad and glad and bad?

            <h2>The Tortoise and the Hare</h2>
            <p>One day a <span class="specialspan">hare</span> was bragging about how fast he could run. He bragged and
                bragged and even laughed at the tortoise, who was so slow. The tortoise stretched out his long neck and
                challenged the hare to a race, which, of course, made the hare laugh.
                "My, my, what a joke!" thought the hare.
                "A race, indeed, a race. Oh! what fun! My, my! a race, of course, Mr. Tortoise, we shall race!" said the
                hare.</p>

            <h2>The Ugly Duckling</h2>
            <p>It was so <span class="specialspan">beautiful</span> out on the country, it was summer- the wheat fields
                were golden, the oats were green, and down among the green meadows the hay was stacked. There the stork
                minced about on his red legs, clacking away in Egyptian, which was the language his mother had taught
                him. Round about the field and meadow lands rose vast forests, in which deep lakes lay hidden. Yes, it
                was indeed lovely out there in the country.</p>
